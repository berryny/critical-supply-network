  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preparing a 100 image mask dataset - <br>
      (i) downloading the images of masks from google<br>
      (ii) clicking some images of masks from different angles(it'd be good if u are having some defective masks)
    </li>
    <li>
      Using GANs on 100 image dataset to generate fake images of defective masks
    </li>
    <li>
      Building a computer vision model on the above prepared dataset which has two classes, whether the mask is
      ready for use or not.
    </li>
    <li>
      Quantizing the model to use it on a raspberry pi or a webcam.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using an object counting sensor on a conveyor belt. (For counting objects we'd need programming in
      raspberry pi)
    </li>
    <li>
      Updating the logistics on the website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using Machine Learning for exploratory data analysis and getting prepared for future pandemics.
    </li>
  </ol>
